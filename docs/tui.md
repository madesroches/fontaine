# The terminal UI

`fontaine` without `-p` starts the terminal UI. It needs a terminal: with piped standard input or
output it exits with code 2 and points at `fontaine -p`. Configuration, accounts and permission
rules work as in headless runs; the mode is the one from `[permissions] default_mode` or
`--permission-mode`. With neither set, the terminal UI starts in `auto`, the mode where the
[guardian](guardian.md) judges each call that nothing pre-approved.

The screen has a transcript, an input box and a status bar. The transcript shows your messages
(`>`), the streaming answer, and one line per tool call with its status: pending, done, failed,
denied with the reason, or interrupted. A call the guardian refused shows its rule label and the
guardian's own explanation on lines of their own, for example `[Download+Execute] pipes a download
into a shell`.

## Status bar

The bar shows the permission mode, the model and a key hint. The mode labels are `manual`,
`⏵⏵ accept edits on`, `⏸ plan mode on`, `⏵⏵ auto mode on` and `dontAsk`.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Enter | Submit. Alt+Enter, Shift+Enter or Ctrl+J insert a newline; a trailing `\` before Enter also continues the line. |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle the mode: manual, accept edits, plan, auto, and back to manual. It takes effect on the next tool call, even mid-turn. Entering `auto` lists the broad allow rules it sets aside and says so when the guardian cannot be asked. |
| Esc, Ctrl-C while a turn runs | Interrupt the turn. The interrupted turn is discarded, earlier turns are kept, and an open prompt is answered with deny. |
| Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-D on an empty input, when idle | Quit. |
| PageUp, PageDown | Scroll the transcript, or the command in an open approval prompt. |
| Arrows, Home, End, Backspace, Delete, Ctrl-A/E/U/K/W/B/F | Edit the input. |

## Approval prompts

When a call needs approval, a prompt lists the call and why it asked:

- `y` allow once.
- `s` allow session, when the prompt offers it.
- `a` always allow, when the prompt offers it. The prompt shows the exact rule that will be added
  to `[permissions] allow` in your user settings file.
- `n` deny. Enter on the deny row opens an optional reason, which is sent to the model with the
  denial.

Up, Down and Tab move the highlight, Enter confirms. Prompts forced by the floor (an `ask` rule, a
critical path, a protected path) and shell calls that are not one literal simple command offer
only allow once and deny. Enter and the letter keys are ignored for the first 400 ms after a prompt
opens, and key repeats never answer, so text typed ahead during a turn cannot approve a call. See [Permissions](permissions.md) for what each answer does.

## When the guardian asks

An `escalate` verdict opens the usual approval prompt with the guardian's `[Rule] explanation`
as the reason. These prompts offer only allow once and deny, because a lasting grant would take
the question away from the guardian.

After three denials in a row, or twenty in a session, `auto` pauses: a notice says so and the
next call that needs the guardian asks you instead. Approving a call resumes `auto`.

If the guardian model named by `[guardian] model` cannot be used at all (no credential, an
unknown account), nothing is substituted silently. A prompt offers:

- `r` retry: look the pinned model up again, for when its credential has appeared.
- `p` pick another validated guardian: the models of `guardian_models.toml` and the models your
  accounts list explicitly, for this session. `/guardian-model` makes the choice permanent.
- `m` switch the session to `manual` and ask you about this call.
- `n` leave the call denied.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/add-dir <path>` | Adds a workspace root. The path is validated and canonicalized like `--add-dir`; file tools may reach it from the next turn, with the conversation kept. Until then a file-tool call outside the roots is denied with a hint naming this command. Only between turns. |
| `/denied` | Lists the calls the guardian denied this session, with their rule label and explanation. Up and Down select; `r` approves the selected call once, as if you had approved it at a prompt, and tells the agent on its next turn that it may retry exactly that call. The retry runs without asking the guardian, never enters the verdict cache and does not count toward the denial limits. The deterministic floor still runs first, so an `ask` rule or a critical path still prompts. Esc closes the list. |
| `/model [<account>/<model>]` | Without an argument, shows the model and the guardian. With one, switches the live session to that model, rebuilds the agent on it with the conversation kept, and saves it as `[model] model` in your user settings file. The guardian moves with it only when it is on the main-model fallback (no `[guardian] model` and no validated model available); a pinned or validated guardian stays. |
| `/guardian-model [<account>/<model>]` | Without an argument, shows the guardian and the models it could be. With one, pins the guardian to that model for the live session and saves it as `[guardian] model`. A model whose account has no credential becomes an unavailable guardian, which the next adjudication reports. |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Leave. |
